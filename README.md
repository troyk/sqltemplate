Cool SQL Templates for Go, tailored to postgresql and it's JSON awesomeness

About
-----

This library is under heavy flux, being developed as part of a couple apps
I'm deploying to production soon.  The gist is Go does not have a decent ORM 
and I'm not sure it needs one.  Go has awesome support for serializing to/from JSON 
and structs and just about anything can be done with JSON and a modern postgresql 
server.  My hunch is this is a marriage made in heaven, but I'll know in a week if the 
Devil has me by the tail.
